    <p>I admire the African Lions for their muscular features as well as their ferocious protection of their community. They live in groups, of about forty, called prides. </p>
    <p>The male of the prides protect their territory, while the females are the hunters and the leaders</p>
    <p>The menacing roar of the males can be heard miles away. </p>
